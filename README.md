--------------------------

HTTP error "418 I'm a teapot" was defined in the april fools jokes of 1998 and 2014. It was defined for the RFC 2324 aka. Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol. The error is returned when a server refuses to brew coffee because it is a teapot. Sadly the RFC is not completely implemented on this site, so you can't brew coffee here. But you can still enjoy the error message.
